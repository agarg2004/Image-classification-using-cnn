# Image-classification-using-cnn
This is an image classification model trained using convoltuional neural networks on a custom images dataset containing images of 13 people( classes).


# How to run the code
https://github.com/agarg2004/Image-classification-using-cnn/blob/main/cnn_updated_code
The above file contains the final code of convolutional neural network implementation on the custom images dataset. It can be run on any python interpreter containing the required dependencies.

# About the dataset
The images_dataset_mlsc contains the unlabelle, unanotated images dataset. Annoated images contains only those images which have been labelled and the labels have been stored in dataset_new.csv. The reference_images and test_images folder can be used for testing.

# Accuracy
This model is having an accuracy of 70% which can be increased by hyperparameter tuning like modifying the learning rate, batch size, number of filters and performing preprocessing of data like rehaping, resizing, grayscaling, etc.
